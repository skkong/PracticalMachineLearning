# Practical Machine Learning

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. I will use any of the other variables to predict with. I would create a report describing how I built my model, how used cross validation, what I'm thinking the expected out of sample error is, and why I made the choices. I will also use my prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
